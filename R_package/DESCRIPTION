Description: StarVZ consists in a performance analysis workflow that combines
    the power of the R language (and the tidyverse realm) and many auxiliary
    tools to provide a consistent, flexible, extensible, fast, and versatile
    framework for the performance analysis of task-based applications that run
    on top of the StarPU runtime (with its MPI layer for multi-node support).
    Its goal is to provide a fruitful prototypical environment to conduct
    performance analysis hypothesis-checking for task-based applications that
    run on heterogeneous (multi-GPU, multi-core) multi-node HPC platforms.
